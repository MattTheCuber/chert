The reverse-chronological ordering of blogs causes the first post to
appear last in the archive. This should make a [colophon][colophon]
the [King's Pawn Game][kingspawn] of web authorship.

This site is generated with [Chert][chert_github], an open-source
static site generator built with [Python][python], [Markdown][markdown], and [YAML][yaml].

No programming-enabled blog would be complete without a particular
code snippet, with highlighting provided by [pygments][pygments]:

    :::python
    def greet(name):
        print('Hello, %s!' % name)

    # Prints the greeting to sys.stdout
    greet('world')


**Hello, world!**
