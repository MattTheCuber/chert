This is a brand new post just waiting to be filled out by a willing
author. Features abound, so in addition to staving off slate
blankness, this post acts as a quick-start reference.

## Definition lists and footnotes

Python
:   A constricting snake belonging to the family [Pythonidae][pythonidae].
:   A high-level, multi-purpose programming language used to generate this site.
Chert
:   A sedimentary rock historically used to start fires.
:   The open-source static site generator used to generate this page.

Now it's time for that very special and very ubiquitous code snippet,
with highlighting provided by [pygments][pygments]:

    :::python
    def greet(name):
        print('Hello, %s!' % name)

    # Prints the greeting to sys.stdout
    greet('world')

**Hello, world!** And enjoy using Chert!
