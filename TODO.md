# TODO

* Look for a user-controlled module that is imported/executed and
  converted into values available in the render context. This way
  users can customize themes to include custom computable values.

* Directory-based layout instead. Each entry is an index.html within
  its own directory. Static files referenced by the post are copied
  into the static directory of the entry, making the whole entry
  roughly self-contained.
